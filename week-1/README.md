### Assignment

1. Create an account at hub.docker.com
2. Install Docker (recommended) OR make yourself familiar with labs.play-with-docker.com using your DockerID from the step I
3. Containerize a SIMPLE hello-world application in the language/framework of your choice. Don’t take a complex system but **prefer a simple one**, like the Flask example we did today. It’s the week I assignment after all, we will cover more advanced scenarios next week! Push the created image to your docker repository at the docker hub as shown in the video.
4. Ensure you used every command from today’s class - both for Dockerfile and command line.
5. Invite a friend or a colleague! If you are at this slide with us, it means you liked the class, don’t you? It’s week I so it’s still the perfect time to jump in!
